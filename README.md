# Metro Nashville Emergency Communications

During the tornado on March 3rd, 2020 and the derecho on May 3rd, 2020, Nashville Emergency Communications received a number of 911 calls and dispatches were issued to address them. We have been given data for the calls and dispatches around these times and will analyze the data to gain insights. Some possible directions for your analysis are:
- A timeline of each storm
- Beginning and end of the event
- Times of stronger storm impacts, based on call volumes
- The geographic path of the storm generating reports of damage or impact
- Locations of heaviest storm impact based on call volume
- Locations less impacted or not impacted, based on call volume (or lack thereof)
- The types of structures impacted (Residential? Commercial?)
- Communities within the County most impacted by the storms?
- A comparison of the storm paths with areas of the community impacted by Covid today (map available at https://nashville.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=30dd8aa876164e05ad6c0a1726fc77a4)
- A correlation identifying the demographic and economic realities of each community impacted by the storm and to what severity

### Approach:
Start by **Exploring the data** to identify possible areas of interest as well as any issues in the data you will have to address before continuing your analysis. Note down any trends, visualizations, outlier data points, etc. that you find interesting.

We will then reconvene as a class and decide on the direction that each group will pursue for their main analysis.

### Timeline for the project:
- Wednesday 11/11 afternoon - Thursday 11/12 morning: Kick off the project and begin EDA
- Thursday 11/12 afternoon: Finalize the main analysis for each group
- Friday 11/13 - Monday 11/16 morning: Work on analysis
- Monday 11/16 afternoon: Project check-in with Team Leads
- Tuesday 11/17 morning: Continue analysis and put together presentation
- Tuesday 11/17 afternoon: Presentation walkthrough
- Wednesday 11/18 morning: Finalize presentation (and practice!)
- Wednesday 11/18 afternoon: Presentation to Metro

Depending on the analysis for each group, we may have one presentation for the entire class or multiple presentations. The total length of the presentation(s) should be 1 hour.
